## What is BitWHIP

BitWHIP is your swiss army knife for low latency screen sharing. With BitWHIP you can publish your desktop with 30ms of latency.
This video can be sent P2P or to a server. You can watch your BitWHIP generated stream in BitWHIP or on your browser, phone, tv 
or even your car!

BitWHIP is built on open protocols so should work pretty much anywhere.  BitWHIP uses WHIP so it can be sent to [Broadcast Box][discord-invite-url], 
Twitch, Cloudflare or any WHIP server of your choice. It should also interop with your favorite tools and libraries like
OBS, FFmpeg or GStreamer.
